Background
==================================
KMB has a website and mobile application to track bus arrival time. We can improve it by digest such data and visualize it on a map, such that we can see the overall traffic status.
Note that we shall not be bounded to KMB, the system should accept other data source as well, and we are not limited to show bus.

Goal
==================================
The goal of this project is to make a portal / platform which fetch data from KMB and process it such that we can estimate buses location and display on Google Map. The bus location should be update and it looks like real time traffic monitor.
As there are about 3920 buses on KMB, we usually donâ€™t display all buses at once (but it looks so fun), we shall provide a filter mechanic on the platform.

Setup
==================================
Comming soon.
